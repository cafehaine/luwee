# Luwee
## What is Luwee

Luwee is a lua library to create [weechat relay](https://weechat.org/files/doc/stable/weechat_relay_protocol.en.html)
clients.

It supports SSL encryption, but not much more.

## How to use it

At the moment, given the lack of documentation, the best way to see how luwee
works is to run and look at the code of the demo client. It uses [moonfltk](https://github.com/stetre/moonfltk)
for it's GUI, but also my own [striter](https://github.com/cafehaine/striter)
and [luaprettyprint](https://github.com/cafehaine/luaprettyprint) (only for used
for debugging, this requirement will go away).
